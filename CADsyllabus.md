# Make things move and CAD

In this class, we would make moving objects using Fusion 360. You are expected to learn Fusion 360 and how to use it to do mechanical simulation. As a homage to the WORLD SCULPTURE RACING SOCIETY in boston, we would make moving objects and racing. Students would be paired in a group of 2.

Every students would be given the same motor and the same battery. It is recommended to lasercut as prototype. The project should use just one motor for all the movements.

This would be a class that students would need to change their design in Fusion 360 and lasercut multiple times in order to build a moving object. So I think it is actually a CAD class.

It is a class that would allow hotglue, duck tape. The key point is to make things move.

## week1:

I would buy some lasercut toys, let students play with it while introducing this class. 

## week2:

Use Motiongenpro to understand linkages, During class we would design linkage system and do a cardboard prototype together.

Assignment: Using linkages to make a kinetic "image" that could fit into a given size frame.

## week3:

review the kinetic image. 2D drawing in Fusion 360. How to export it and lasercut it.

Also, we would look at some artistic machines. The history of Machine Art. 

Assignment: in a group of 2, think about final idea.

## week4:

3D modeling in Fusion 360(sculpting not covered). How do we find components in McMaster and modify it for our need. How to export the model and 3D print it.

Share Final Ideas.

Assignment: Sketch and start 3D modeling for final projects 

## week5: 

Assemble joints in Fusion 360. How to do a slide, a rotary joint with simple lasercut prototype.. How different gears would work? 

Assignment: Make an assembled model in fusion for final project

## week6:

How to go beyond Lasercut? Components we might need in a more dedveloped kinetic movement

## week7:

do the actual racing. Critique. Share kinetic Artist's story. (Hopefully could invite some artists for critique)
