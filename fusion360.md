By default Fusion will capture every change made to your design in a tieline. This process is called Parametric Modeling and is great when you need to capture specific features and define the relationship between parts.

Turning off design history allows you to work in a Direct Modeling environment. This lets you quickly create geometry without having to worry about individual features.

Hover over the face and press control/command on mac
