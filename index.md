#### Club Spirit
1. We are not dumb mechanics. We are trying to bring the softness and tenderness in ourselves to those movements. Those engineers are admirable.
2. Movement could bring a sculpture a second life.
3. Physical movement and virtual movement is different. We love to play with the limitation of physical things.
4. We love to play and observe movements.
