# Kinetic Art

This is more about a poetic expression of movement. We would make things into a kinetic sculpture. It is also a class based on fusion 360. The final project is to make a small exhibtion on floor and make things move for at least a week. Projects to be expected, a flower that would bloosom mechanically.. a rotating light installation.. a planetary gear installation.. 

## Week1: 

DC motor control (linear actuator)

Using the standing wave as an introduction, every students would use a dc motor to make a simple sculpture. 

Expecting outcome: a rotating lamp, a motor spins a mop head like something at different speed that would result in different shapes. A feather being spinning. A bottle of water rotating and create waves...

## Week2:
