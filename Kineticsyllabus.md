# Kinetic Art

This is more about a poetic expression of movement. We would make things into a kinetic sculpture. It is also a class based on fusion 360. The final project is to make a small exhibtion on floor and make things move for at least a week. Projects to be expected, a flower that would bloosom mechanically.. a rotating light installation.. a planetary gear installation.. 

## Week1: 

DC motor control (linear actuator)

Assignment: Using the standing wave as an introduction, every students would use a dc motor to make a simple sculpture. 

Expecting outcome: a rotating lamp, a motor spins a mop head like something at different speed that would result in different shapes. A feather being spinning. A bottle of water rotating and create waves...

## Week2:

Review students work. 

How to mount motors, introduce stepper motor and its drivers.

Discussion about the poetic expression of movements. Show some kinetic art examples(whose mechanical structure is not so complicated)

## Week3:

Fusion 360 modeling introduction.

Introducing Final requirements: The recommended bearing, shaft, shaft coupler, screw size, pulley and belt... I want to set up a standard for components so students could possibly borrow components from each other. It might also be possible to use some budget to buy some of them.

Assignment: Think about final ideas and do sketch.

## Week4:

Fusion 360 assembly. Also introduce how to buy different components in fusion 360 for those motion joints and links. gears

Assignment: model the final project in Fusion 360.

## Week5:

talk about how nature inspire kinetic art. How linkage works... we would study the mechanism of many nature inspired kinetic art together.

## Week 6:

Tips for a finished project. Limit switch, hall sensors, how to avoid induction. Wire arrangement and connectors.

The ambiguity and randomness of movements. 

## Week 7:

Presentation, install works in a phone booth for a week and they need to repair it every day. Talk about movements that software can not simulate.
