## Type of Gears

---

**Spur Gear**

Spur gears or straight-cut gears are the simplest type of gear

**Pinion**

A pinion is a round gear—usually the smaller of two meshed gears—used in several applications, including drivetrain and rack and pinion systems.

**Internal Gear**

**Rack**

a type of linear actuator that comprises a circular gear (the pinion) engaging a linear gear (the rack)

**Bevel Gear**

to turn the rotationl movement to another axis.

**Worm Gear**

can only be driven from the shaft side

Question: why music boxes use worm gears?

The higher the pressure angle, the higher the tooth strength. A lower pressue angle gear has less noise. A bigger contact ratio lowers the noise. Decreasing the pressure angle and/or increasing the tooth depth can produce a larger contact ratio.

**Task one:**

transmit rotational movement from A to B. 

**Task Two:**

same shaft, one disk is rotating clockwise while another one is rotating counter-clockwise
