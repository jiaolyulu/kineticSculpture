![image of an automata which is a machine full of mechanical moving part to write and draw something. The machine is made into the shape of a little boy](images/clubSpiritAutomata1.gif)

this extraordinary little doll is actually a self-operating machine that's believed by some to be one of the oldest examples of a computer. Known as “The Writer,” the automaton was built by Swiss-born watchmaker Pierre Jaquet-Droz in order to entertain nobility and promote watches.

### Club Spirit
1. We are not dumb mechanics. We are trying to bring the softness and tenderness in ourselves to those movements. Those engineers are admirable. (lulu)
2. Movement could bring a sculpture a second life. (lulu)
3. Physical movement and virtual movement is different. We love to play with the limitation of physical things. (lulu)
4. We love to play and observe motion. (lulu)
5. We acknowledge that the motion of matter is the basics of our world. (lulu)
6. Motion is honest, it can not lie (lulu)
7. The world moves, why shouldn't art (Danny)
8. Movement is a form of capturing reality (Etienne Jules Marey / Aike)
9. Kinetic sculptures shape itself (Ziwei)
10. always break something (Angelo)
11. I don’t have a sentence but I have an idea (Stela, inspired by Suraj)
12. Kinetic impressionism. Capturing reality/ truth beyond visual realism via movement (Aike)
13.

SCULPTURE RACING IS FUN

SCULPTURE RACING IS SERIOUS

SCULPTURE RACING IS HIGHBROW ART

SCULPTURE RACING IS KITSCH

SCULPTURE RACING IS ABSURD

SCULPTURE RACING IS PROFOUND

SCULPTURE RACING IS OBVIOUS

SCULPTURE RACING IS PARADOXICAL

SCULPTURE RACING IS A FAD

SCULPTURE RACING IS AN ENDURING CONTRIBUTION TO THE HISTORY OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION

SCULPTURE RACING is kinetic art in which both artwork and mover are perceived as one; sculpture races are dynamic groupings of art objects and personalities

SCULPTURE RACING exists in the zone between high art and mass culture; it is moveable art that may appear anywhere, not necessarily where one expects it

SCULPTURE RACING takes art out of the galleries and museums and into the streets

SCULPTURE RACING blends art with the ambience of the popular festival, making it more accessible to the general public

SCULPTURE RACING brings artists out of the isolation of the studio and into public: it brings the public into contact with artist-as-personalities in an atmosphere that is relaxed and open, allowing an easy give-and-take

SCULPTURE RACING offers artists relief from the uncertainties of subjective criticism and art historical evaluation by giving them the clear-cut winner, loser, first, second, third place ranking enjoyed by athletes

SCULPTURE RACING embraces the competitiveness of the modern art world that compels artists to throw themselves into promotion, mass marketing and popular appeals

SCULPTURE RACING is the focus of a protest against the new political conservatism with its accompanying cuts in social programs and funding for the arts, the results of which have engaged artists in all media in a desperate race for survival

SCULPTURE RACING is an art of social-aesthetic dialectics:

Ultimately the “Art of Sculpture Racing” per se will not reside in individual art objects—not even in individual sculpture races—but rather….

![pond art club's testimony for what they believe](/images/池社.jpg)

艺术是一个池

我们的生存有赖于碳水化合物

不是想要这样才这样

而是不得不这样才这样

……

我们渴望恰当的净化

我们的思维是流动的、模糊的。

……

有谁见过理性的冲动?

“浸入”的瞬间令人陶醉。

复苏的瞬间大彻大悟。

……

结果是次要的

种子在不断发芽。
