## **4/6 wire steppers**

---

A typical stepper motor would have 4 wires. Some might have 6 wires. But to use it with our drivers, we can just use 4 wires of the stepper motor.

- **6 wire stepepr motor**

Or it might be a 6 wire with the two center taps tied together.

When we use a bipolar stepper driver, we can see its pin configuration usually like this:

So A1 A2 should be connected to A+ A-, B1 B2 should be connected to B+ B-. According to my experience, the only thing matters is that you should pair them right.

**How do we know the stepper motor A1 A2 B1 B2 pins of a stepper motor?**

Sometimes, the stepper motors are manufactured with different standard and the order of the wire can be totally different. For example, the stepper motor I have and the stepper motor Jason gave me looks similar, and they can use the same mount, but they are wired differently.

**So I use a multimeter! **The coil A is not connected with coil B in a bipolar stepper motor. If you measure the 2 resistance of coil A1 and coil A2, it should be very small. In this case, the resistance is just 3.2 Î©.

Or we can tear it down.

### **StealthChop & SpreadCycle**



StealthChop is a quiet mode of operation for stepper motors at standstill and at low velocities. It is based on a voltage mode PWM. 

While stealthChop is a voltage mode PWM controlled chopper, spreadCycle is a cycle-by-cycle current control. It can react extremely fast to changes in motor velocity or motor load. spreadCycle will give better performance in medium to high velocity range for motors and applications which tend to resonance.

- **5 wire stepepr motor**

A 5 wire motor might just be a 4 wire motor with a frame-ground connection.
